	            <h3><a href="">Project Brief</a></h3>
	            <p>For this project, my goal is to effectively and creatively convey the history of tequila. I will utilize HTML and CSS (and hopefully some JavaScript) coding language in order to create a digital story that, upon completion, will be published as a standalone website. My aim is to also include graphics and animations made by myself to assist the story I am trying to convey.<p>

	           <p>My aim throughout this project is to be able to reach satisfactory levels for the deliverables for every checkpoint of the project. For this first checkpoint I will be detailing how my process for this whole project is going to go. First, I came up with the idea of creating a digital story that involved cocktails or mixed drinks of some kind. After narrowing down my topic, I came to the idea of creating a digital story detailing the history of Tequila, the first liquor developed in North America whose roots span to before Christopher Colombus arrived at the continent.</p>

	           <p>Below can be found a list of topics which I believe would be interesting to include in the timeline for the origin of Tequila: </p>

	           <p> - Pre-hispanic Pulque </p>

	           <p> - Spaniards run out of brandy — they start distilling the agave liquor —  mezcal brandy, agave wine, mezcal tequila, and finally simply tequila</p>
	           <p> - Mezcal Wine — Grandparent of tequila</p>
	           <p> - Origin of name tequila — Town near Jalisco called Tequila</p>
	           <p> - Etymology: Native Nahuatl language: Combination of tequitl (work, duty, job or task) and tlan (place)</p>
	           <p> - The Nahuatl called the plant metl or mexcametl – from which the word mezcal is derived. For them it was a divine plant, worshipped as the earthly representation of the goddess Mayaheul, who had 400 breasts to feed her 400 children, the Centzon Totchtin.</p>
	           <p> - The plant plays a much larger role than just being the source of an alcoholic drink. Its leaves are used for a hemp-like fibre that was used for mats, clothing, rope and paper.</p>
	           <p> - Don Pedro Sanches de Tagle, Marquis of Altamira, the 'father of tequila,' established the very first tequila factory in his Hacienda Cuisillos, in 1600, cultivating the local agave for distillation </p>
	           <p> - In 1651, Spanish doctor Jeronimo Hernandez wrote that tequila (mezcal) was used for medicinal purposes, including rheumatic cures by rubbing tequila on the affected parts of the body.</p>
	           <p> - Modern tequila is only made from the Blue Agave Plant. </p>
	           <p> - Modern Mezcal can be made from over 30 different types of agave including the Maguey.</p>
	           <p>Throughout the process of crafting the digital story, some of these topics might get cut and some topics might be added if further research is needed.</p>
	           <p>After the initial research is done, I will create a script and a storyboard in order to solidify the creative direction in which I want the project to go. Also, with the completion of the storyboard, I will be able to clearly see the scope of everything I need to create in terms of graphics and animations for the project to meet my expectations.</p>
	           <p>Once the script and storyboard have been fleshed out completely, I will start to code in the user interface for the digital story’s website. My initial idea for this is to have it be a click-to-continue system in which the user clicks an arrow at the bottom right of their screen in order to move on to the next part of the story. The progression in between sections of the timeline will be transitioned with either simple swipes from one area to another and in some special occasions, there will be custom animations. An idea for an animation is filling the screen with a silver, yellow, brown liquids like the different colors of tequila to transition to a new page with a background of that color. Another idea for an animated transition could be a screen swipe caused by a barrel rolling through the screen.</p>
	           <p>Once everything is finished, and the product is something I can be proud of, it will be published through GitHub and made available for the world to see. I hope that with this project I am able to learn a lot about crafting a narrative and turning it into a website that is accessible by anyone. </p>
